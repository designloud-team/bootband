bootband
========

Development-ready WordPress starter theme.

[Demo](http://bootband.developmentdoma.in/)

##Introduction

This is a WordPress theme template that I've put together for personal and freelance projects. It uses awesome stuff like [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome), [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones), and [Redux Framework](https://github.com/ReduxFramework/redux-framework).

##Changelog
###2.0.0
- Updated Bootstrap to v3.2.0
- Removed a bunch of unnecessary or redundant files.
- Removed Glyphicons
- Added a few of Bootstrap overrides to style.css
- Moved project to GitHub

##Versioning
I try to follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) as much as possible.

##FAQ
<dl>
	<dt>Can I contribute?</dt>
	<dd>Possibly. I created this to use for personal projects but if you have something you'd really like to see added please feel free to get in touch.</dd>
	<dt>Can I use this for...?</dt>
	<dd>This project is licensed under GPL.</dd>
	<dt>What's with the errors when I activate the theme?</dt>
	<dd>Go into the theme options panel and hit save.</dd>
	<dt>What's with all the random theme options?</dt>
	<dd>That's the Redux Framework sample-config. I keep all that nonsense in there as a reference when I'm building a theme-specific options panel.</dd>
	<dt>What's with the name?</dt>
	<dd>Bootbands are the simplest, most basic part of the Marine Corps utility uniform, similar to how this theme is a simple foundation from which I build WordPress themes. Also, because naming stuff is probably the hardest part of creating anything.</dd>
